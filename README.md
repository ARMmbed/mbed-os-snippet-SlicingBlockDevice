# SlicingBlockDevice example

This example shows how to use SlicingBlockDevice to partition a heap block device into three subunits. It shows programming and reading back data segments, through both the underlying master block device and sliced subunits. To see this example in context, please see its [published documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/apis/slicingblockdevice.html).
